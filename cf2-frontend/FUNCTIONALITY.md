## 🔌 Integration Points

### Ready for Web3 Implementation

Each component has clearly marked `// TODO: Implement contract interaction` comments where you need to add:

1. **Contract Connection**
   - Connect to deployed CF2 contract
   - Set contract address in Header component

2. **Write Function Calls**
   - Replace console.log statements with actual contract calls
   - Handle transaction confirmations and errors
   - Update UI based on transaction status

3. **Read Function Calls**
   - Replace mock data with actual contract reads
   - Implement real-time data fetching
   - Handle loading and error states

4. **Event Listening**
   - Replace mock events with real contract event listening
   - Implement WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
   - Filter events by user/campaign as needed

5. **Wallet Integration**
   - Implement wallet connection in Header
   - Show connected address and network
   - Handle wallet switching and disconnection

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Install Web3 Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install ethers wagmi @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
   ```

2. **Configure Contract**
   - Add contract ABI
   - Set contract address
   - Configure network settings

3. **Implement Functions**
   - Start with read functions (easier to test)
   - Add write functions with proper error handling
   - Implement event listening

4. **Test Integration**
   - Test with testnet first
   - Verify all function calls work correctly
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

The UI is production-ready and provides an excellent foundation for your Web3 integration!
